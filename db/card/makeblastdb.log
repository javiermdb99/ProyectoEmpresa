Bad char [0xCE] in string at byte 414
Shotgun cloning of beta-lactam resistant P. aeruginosa NRZ-03096 yielded a clone producing a novel subclass B1 enzyme with only 74.3% identity to the next nearest relative, KHM-1. The novel MBL was named HMB-1 (for Hamburg MBL). HMB-1 gene was chromosomally located as part of a Tn 3 family transposon that was named Tn 6345, where expression of bla HMB-1 in E. coli TOP10 led to increased resistance to Î²-lactams.

Bad char [0xCE] in string at byte 271
Klebsiella pneumoniae outer membrane porin protein. Is preferentially detected in porin-deficient strains. Functional characterization of this new porin revealed a narrower pore than those of porins OmpK35 and OmpK36, which did not allow penetration by certain Î²-lactams. Also, when a resistant strain expresses porin OmpK37 is less susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoxitin than when it is expressing either OmpK36 or OmpK35.
